Rehabilitation Calculator exercise 
input ->  A = array of integers, n = size of array, X - numbers of appointments , Y numbers of days between each appointment
Output-> minimal days to complete X rehabilitations
Assumptions â€“ N, X in range of [2,200000]
Element in A in range of [1,1000]
Y in range of [1,199,999]
N > (X-1) *Y
Examples:
A [4,2,3,7], X = 2, Y = 2 -> result = 7
A [4,2,3,7], X = 2, Y = 3 -> result = 17
A [4,2,3,7], X = 3, Y = 2 -> result = 6
